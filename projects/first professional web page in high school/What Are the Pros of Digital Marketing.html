        <h2>1. Digital marketing is very low cost.</h2>
        <p>If you’re running a shoestring budget, then you can’t beat what digital marketing can provide. Some platforms can even be operated for free if you’re willing to put in the sweat equity to get results. Even if you’re paying professionals for your digital marketing efforts, however, the costs can be up to 50-75% lower than comparable marketing efforts with the same potential outreach.</p>

 	      <h2>2. Digital marketing can access a massive audience.</h2>
        <p>The issue you have with traditional marketing efforts is that you must target a generalized demographic. You can target TV viewers, for example, or radio program listeners or magazine readers. Direct mail can reach a specific zip code or neighborhood. Digital marketing, however, can reach an entire globe. There is no limit to the scope of this process. As long as someone is connected to the internet in some way, you can reach them with a marketing message.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Digital marketing caters to multiple demographics simultaneously. </h2>
        <p>This might be the biggest advantage you receive when implementing a digital marketing plan. No matter how specific your targeted demographics happen to be, you can have your message reach people within that group. Gender, age, socioeconomic status – virtually everyone is online or can connect to the internet on a regular basis today.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Digital marketing is fast – like super ultra fast. </h2>
        <p>According to Statistic Brain, the average attention span for someone online right now is 8.25 seconds. For the record – that’s shorter than the attention span of a goldfish. It’s a good thing then that digital marketing is fast enough to keep up with these shorter attention spans. One status update, one helpful post, or one responsive comment is all that is needed to get your branding message to the top of a prospect’s mind.</p>

      <div class="Image5"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Digital marketing reaches decision-makers. </h2>
        <p>About 2 in 3 adults who have access to the internet and regularly use blogs, social media, and other online communication tools consider themselves to be the decision-makers in their homes. This means you get to reach the people who decide how to spend their money instead of reaching only the people who need to ask someone else if they can buy what you’re offering.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2> 6. Digital marketing creates brand interactions.</h2>
        <p>Business transactions will always involve two components: how well you can solve a problem and how deep the relationship is you have with a customer. Digital marketing encourages brand interactions, which helps you to build up effective relationships. As long as your products, services, and digital marketing efforts offer a strong value proposition, you’ve always got an opportunity to make a sale.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Digital marketing offers you an opportunity to expand your customer service.</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest complaints customers typically have about a brand or company is the lack of customer service they receive. If you’re on Twitter, Facebook, or quickly respond to emails that are sent, then you can get ahead of certain issues that might come up during the sales process. This can help to eliminate some of the negative feedback that might head your way and eventually damage your online reputation if it happens frequently enough.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Digital marketing creates higher levels of brand loyalty. </h2>
        <p>Relationships create loyalty. Loyalty creates repetitive business opportunities. It is far more profitable to attract repeat customers than it is to constantly reach out to first-time buyers. Digital marketing can help you establish the loyalty that you’ll need to solidify your business presence.</p>
