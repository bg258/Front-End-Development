        <h2>1. Digital marketing is going to consume a lot of your time. </h2>
        <p>According to data compiled by Social Media Today, more than 60% of digital marketers report spending at least 6 hours per day on their digital marketing efforts. About 1 in 3 digital marketers say that they spend 11+ hours working online every day. This means it may not cost a lot to get a marketing campaign up and running from a financial standpoint, but you’ll need to make a solid sweat equity investment.</p>

 	      <h2>2. Digital marketing always creates negative public reactions. </h2>
        <p>Digital marketing will attract plenty of people within a targeted demographic. The only trouble is not every person is going to have a positive response to your efforts. There will be negative responses, especially from people who may feel like your brand has wronged them in some way. There are trolls that may work to destroy your brand reputation because it’s “fun” for them to do. Scammers, spammers, and other trouble is lurking out there as well. You’ve got to have a thick skin when you’re working online today.</p>

        <h2>3. Digital marketing sometimes takes control out of your hands.</h2>
        <p>Sometimes this can be a good thing because your campaign goes viral and you end up receiving a lot of unexpected exposure to your brand message. It can also be a bad thing when someone takes your marketing campaign, publishes negative content about it, and their post ends up going viral. You really can do everything right and still discover that your brand reputation has been tarnished at the end of the day.</p>

        <h2>4. Digital marketing can make it difficult to determine your ROI. </h2>
        <p>Only 1 in 3 digital marketers report that they can reliably measure the results they receive from their digital marketing efforts. Another 1 in 3 digital marketers say that they don’t know if they are measuring their metrics or Key Performance Indicators correctly. The other digital marketer in that group of 3? Yeah – they don’t even know how to measure their ROI. This is an area you’ve got to get sorted out before you get your campaign up and running.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Digital marketing sometimes takes control out of your hands again. </h2>
        <p>When you are working online, you are relying on the services of others being reliable and accessible. If your digital marketing efforts revolve around Facebook and that site has a prolonged outage, then your campaign has a prolonged outage as well. It is far too easy to put all of your eggs into one basket to save some time when running a campaign, but that can backfire in a big way.</p>

        <h2>6. Digital marketing campaigns are very easy to copy. </h2>
        <p>It literally takes two clicks of the mouse to copy information from your campaign efforts. Sometimes all that is needed to take away a market share from your efforts is to trade out one logo for another one. You must remain vigilant when marketing online to make sure that your efforts aren’t being used against you by your competitors at the end of the day.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Digital marketing can get lost in the online white noise that exists. </h2>
        <p>People are inundated with information today. This causes many people to either skim information or to completely ignore it because they are feeling overwhelmed. If your campaign feels like internet advertising, you might find more people are ignoring what you have to say just because they have information fatigue.</p>

      <div class="Image8"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Digital marketing judges you on first impressions. </h2>
        <p>First impressions matter everywhere, of course, but they might be the most important aspect of a digital marketing effort. If the first impression of your campaign is unprofessional in any way, your products or services aren’t going to be taken seriously by a majority of people who encounter it. You must be targeting people in ways that are appropriate for your product or service in order to establish the positive first impression that is needed.</p>
